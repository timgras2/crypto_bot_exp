So I get a Trezor S3 and start my new round of stacking sats. Finally reach 0.15! Hope I can reach 0.2 by the end of this year.\n\nBut I also realized that my IBIT is almost stuck there, since it may take several hours to sell - withdraw - and re-purchase spot BTC, and the price may change radically in that period of time. Not sure how to cope with them. Does anybody has suggestion?",

The next big economic shift will be AI actually replacing peoples jobs, not just the concept or the idea of it happening. The rates will need to be lowered to ensure people can be employed and inflation will become higher. The rates decreasing meaning people have a bigger appetite for risk (Bitcoin, although Bitcoin volatility will steadily decrease) and inflation will rise, meaning that Bitcoin will be used to hedge the risk of inflation especially for countries with unstable fiat. The rise of AI also supports decentralized systems and Bitcoin will benefit greatly from that. \n\n…and the mystery man Satoshi Nakamoto will be the richest man in the world. \n\nI’m 15 and even I can realize this. BTC is taking over the world.",

Honestly, I've been sticking to my weekly DCA for like 8 months now, but man, watching these charts lately has me thinking about throwing more at it. You know that feeling when you're at the blackjack table and the cards just feel right? That's kinda where I'm at with BTC right now.\n\nI keep telling myself \"stick to the plan, stick to the plan\" but part of me wants to just dump a bigger chunk in. It's like when you're playing poker and you get dealt pocket aces, you know? The logical part of my brain says DCA is the way, but the gambler in me is screaming to go bigger.\n\nI've been managing my crypto portfolio like I manage my poker bankroll, only putting in what I can afford to lose, but these price movements got me second-guessing if I'm being too conservative. Maybe that's the whole point of DCA though, to save us from our own fomo and bad timing.",

Bit was stored on a cold wallet for a long time. Plugged it in and couldn't remember the password. Shit. 2 fails with one left before it is wiped. I don't want to risk it so I pull out my seed phrase. Try to restore nothing. The money is gone. \n\nTell the wife we are wrecked and already agreed to close on the house and have no money. We cry.. tell the children we are not getting the house. More crying. Totally crushed. sit in front of the computer completely destroyed, wondering should I cash out every bullshit non crypto investment and be house poor? everyone had such high hopes we would move out of a crappy rental. This is our life now.\n\n Fuck it. I know I was some weird psycho a long time ago and did something to protect my assets. I try the seed phrase backwards. Boom! in! Cashed out and never looked back. What a dumbass. \n\n I still believe in BTC and will get back in but a word of advice:\n\n remember your security ways cause it can be lost real quick. Keep holding this is just the start! Move your coins every year, secure your seed, have a backpack up plan, buy new cold wallets (my screen was fading and unreadable), and watch it grow! don't crush your dreams cause you almost forget what I did.\n\n Bitcoin is the only way now. When you worry just look where it all started and know that the coaster only goes up!\n\n Much love to this community and keeping me going when I refused to sell during the peaks and kept me sane during the lows.

You could have invested in any other company in the snp500 or even the snp500 and you'd be up at least 10%.\n\nIf you take inflation into account, you're down quite a bit, even a savings account would have netted you 5% or so with no risk.\n\nEven 4 years ago, btc hit 69-70k, and had you just put your money into snp500, youd have better returns and less headache.\n\nWith these diminishing returns, what's the incentive to invest in btc? Why would you take such a big risk instead of just throwing your money into smp500 or something and make a better or similar return with substantially lower risk",
