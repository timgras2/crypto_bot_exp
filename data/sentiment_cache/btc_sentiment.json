I‚Äôm very family oriented ,it‚Äôs just my mother, my sister and I. Just started investing in real estate and currently am working on growing my income through wholesale real estate \n\nMy main objective is to own 1 btc by the age of 30 even if that means eventually taking on debt to buy more btc (in a bear market)\n\nI swear sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm going crazzzy because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm chasing bitcoin and no one but this chat understands,while also having that fear of being wrong since it‚Äôs hard to find people in the real world with a similar mindset \n\nMuch love to everyone and may we all accomplish our goals !",
